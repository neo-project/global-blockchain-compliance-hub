There is currently no legal framework in the European Union specifically tailored for smart contracts. That said, Article 9 of the [Electronic Commerce Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32000L0031) (which applies on both a B2B and B2C basis) requires EU member states to ensure that their legal systems allow contracts to be concluded by electronic means. Otherwise, definitions of a “smart contract” and whether or not a contract is legally binding are likely decided at the member state level.
