One challenge in enforcing smart contract arbitration is whether smart arbitration can be envisaged in contract as the only method to resolve a dispute. Based on EU Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair contract terms and a related European Court of Justice case law called [Mostava Claro v Centro Movil Milenium SL](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-168/05), it seems that this is prohibited. Dispute resolution is likely to be handled differently at the member state level.
