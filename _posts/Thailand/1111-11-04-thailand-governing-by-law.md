### Memorandum of Association
The Memorandum of Association of the company has to be filed with the Commercial Registration Department (Registrar of companies) and must include the name of the company that has been successfully reserved, the province where the company will be located, its business objectives, the capital to be registered, and the names of the three promoters. At least three individuals must sign the Memorandum of Association. The promoters can be foreigners and Thai nationals however, each promoter must be a shareholder of the company. The use of [Thai nominee](https://www.samuiforsale.com/other-miscellaneous/nominee-thai-shareholders.html) promoters/ shareholders by foreigners is prohibited under the Foreigner Business Act (and Land Code Act).

### Articles of Association
The Articles of Association_are the regulations of the company concerning its internal affairs such as weighted voting rights and matters requiring approval and protecting the foreign minority rights within the company through the issue of preference shares. In a later stage preferential rights may be attached to newly issued shares, in other words you have to buy the preference shares by increasing the register capital.
When operating a Thai company with a (Thai) partner (one or more persons who direct the same company), it is advisable to restrict or limit the signing power and independent authority of the directors in the by-laws by requiring joint signatures and joint consent of the directors in all matters of the company, other than maybe day to day management.
