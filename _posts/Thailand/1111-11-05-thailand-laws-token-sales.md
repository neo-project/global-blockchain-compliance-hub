### Crypto Rules via Two Royal Decrees
The control of the digital asset business is currently the responsibility of the Minister of the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in accordance with the [Royal Decree on Digital Asset Businesses, 2561 B.E. (2018 A.D.)](https://www.sec.or.th/TH/SECInfo/LawsRegulation/Documents/Act_Royal_Enactment/enactment_digital_2561_summary_en.pdf) (“the Royal Decree”), which was published in the Royal Gazette on 13 May 2018, and became effective on 14 May 2018.[762](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/cryptocurrency/world-survey.php#_ftn762)

### Regulatory Timeline
The Bank of Thailand issued a circular on February 12, 2018, asking financial institutions to refrain from doing any business involving cryptocurrencies.[763](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/cryptocurrency/world-survey.php#_ftn763)  Bangkok Bank halted transactions involving the trading of cryptocurrencies with a private Thai company, Thai Digital Asset Exchange (TDAX), on February 24, 2018.[764](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/cryptocurrency/world-survey.php#_ftn764)  On February 27, 2018, Krungthai Bank, a state-owned financial institution, halted transactions related to cryptocurrencies with TDAX through the bank’s accounts.[765](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/cryptocurrency/world-survey.php#_ftn765)  According to a news article, the ban will continue even after a new regulation (discussed below) is issued.[766](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/cryptocurrency/world-survey.php#_ftn766)
Though the government expects new laws regarding cryptocurrencies will be enacted in the future, it decided to implement temporary measures to protect cryptocurrency investors.[767](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/cryptocurrency/world-survey.php#_ftn767)  According to news articles, on March 13, 2018, the Cabinet approved the principles of the drafts of two Royal Decrees, one to regulate digital currencies, including cryptocurrencies, transactions, and initial coin offerings (ICOs), and the other to amend the Revenue Code to collect capital gains taxes on cryptocurrencies.[768](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/cryptocurrency/world-survey.php#_ftn768)  The Decrees would require all digital asset transactions, including those of digital asset exchanges, brokers, and dealers, to be registered with the relevant authorities.[769](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/cryptocurrency/world-survey.php#_ftn769)
