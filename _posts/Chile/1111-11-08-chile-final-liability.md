There is no official statement on smart contracts in Chile presently on offer.
 
Literature on smart contracts currently lacks a discussion of the legal implications of those use cases that are unrelated to contract law. Although there is no official statement on smart contract regulation in Chile presently on offer, the Chilean government is currently using smart contracts in a [nation-wide energy project](https://www.coindesk.com/chile-to-use-ethereums-blockchain-to-track-energy-data/).
 
Given the lack of regulation and a central enforcement agency, it is difficult to predict with certainty how such liability issues will be dealt with and resolved.
