See guides and lists of common pitfalls for foreigners to set up firms in the U.S.: [What Non-Residents Need to Consider When Forming a Company in the US](https://www.business.com/articles/what-non-residents-need-to-consider-when-forming-a-company-here-in-the-us/) and [Starting your own US Company as a Foreigner](http://www.hightechstartupworld.com/2012/09/starting-your-own-us-company-as.html).
Foreigners wanting to start a business of any type in the U.S. follow the same procedure required for the US resident. US residency (or citizenship) are not necessary to incorporate in the US. However, non-residents may run into problems in setting up a U.S. business because of visas, or because of opening up a U.S. Bank account.

**Visas**
In order to work in the United States foreigners need to obtain a US work permit. There is no such thing as a state visa - the system is centralized and US visa types are set by teh federal government. The [US Citizens and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/) provides resources and information on visa requirements and processes for working in the United States. The USA has roughly six different types of visas:
- Immigrant (permanent, employer-sponsored workers)
- Family (fiancés, family of current U.S. citizens and green card-holders, family of refugees)
- Humanitarian (refugees and asylum seekers, victims of trafficking, battered spouses and children, etc.)
- Adoption (children adopted overseas and brought into the US)
- Military (citizenship for military members and their dependents)
- Temporary workers (specialized, time-limited professions, athletes, actors, etc.)

**Opening a Bank Account**
You should open a U.S. bank account for your business before you start your business. However, it has recently become somewhat difficult for foreigners to open a U.S. Bank Account. [This source](https://www.business.com/articles/what-non-residents-need-to-consider-when-forming-a-company-here-in-the-us/) recommends three possible ways to get a U.S. bank account.
- “Get a visitor visa, travel to the U.S., go to your bank of choice, and personally open an account.
- Go to a U.S. bank with a local branch in your country of origin for identity verification, if their policies allow such an arrangement.
- Use third-party services to help you set up an account.”

Also note other small differences for foreigners setting up firms in the U.S., taken from [this guide](https://mollaeilaw.com/start-us-business/):
- A foreign citizen may be a corporate officer and/or director, but may not work in the United States or receive a salary or compensation for services provided in the United States unless the foreign citizen has a work permit. If forming a new company, the foreign citizen would need to also obtain a separate work permit to work for the new company.
- Under US tax law, a nonresident alien may own shares in a C corporation, but may not own any shares in an S corporation.
- Foreign citizens will face a slight delay (~30 days) when applying for the EIN (Federal Tax ID).
- You don’t need a US address to incorporate in a US, but you do need a US mailing address through some provider.
