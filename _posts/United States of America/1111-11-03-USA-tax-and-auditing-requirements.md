United States federal and state law codes are complicated and it is recommended that a business works with an accountant to file taxes. 

Corporations subject to U.S. tax must file federal and state income tax returns. Different tax returns are required at the federal and some state levels for different types of corporations or corporations engaged in specialized businesses. 

Your company will need a way to be identified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This is typically done via an Employer Identification Number (EIN), which requires a social security number. For foreign businesses, an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is often given to individuals who have to pay U.S. taxes but are not eligible for a social security number. You use form W-7 to apply for an ITIN. Note that as of January 2013, the IRS changed its policy regarding the documentation needed to obtain an ITIN; you can refer to the IRS instructions on the [IRS Form W-7](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw7.pdf).

When beginning a business, you must decide what form of business entity to establish. Your form of business determines which income tax return form you have to file. The most common forms of business are the sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, and S corporation. A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a business structure allowed by state statute. Legal and tax considerations enter into selecting a business structure.
