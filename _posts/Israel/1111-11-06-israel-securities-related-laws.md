An [interim report](http://www.isa.gov.il/sites/ISAEng/1489/1511/Pages/eitinot220318.aspx) released by the Israel Securities Authority in March 2018 suggests that some tokens may be classified as securities, in which case existing securities law will come into play. No timeline for implementation is currently set. 

Please refer to additional legal resources to learn more about relevant laws and regulations regarding your particular exposure (e.g., listing on a securities exchange, sale or transfer of securities, etc.).
