# Nonprofits
Israel has five types of non-profit entities: 
- Associations (“amutot”)
- Public benefit companies/Charitable companies
- Public benefit foundations/Charitable foundations
- Cooperative societies
- Public endowments

Each type has its own formation, governance, membership, and other requirements. All nonprofits must be registered with the Registrar of Corporations. 
 
## Associations 
This is a popular incorporation type. Registration of an association (“amuta”) (requires the following (all citations are to the Law of Associations): 
- Two or more members (either natural persons or legal entities)
- Purpose can be any legal non-profit purpose not geared toward profit-making for members
- Description of activities (primarily non-profit)
- Prohibition on distribution of earnings
- Unique name that is not prejudicial to the public or misleading as to the nature of the organization

Nonprofit associations are not allowed to distribute earnings to members, including founders. 

## Public Benefit Companies (“PBCs”)
Public Benefit Companies are companies set up for non-profit purposes. Unlike associations, PBCs’ purpose must aligned with the Companies Law and fit into one of the predetermined categories of public benefit purposes specified by the law. 
Registration of a PBC requires:
- At least one member

## Public Benefit Foundations (“PBFs”)
Public Benefit Foundations (“PBFs”) are first incorporated as PBCs. They can then apply for PBF status after meeting certain conditions, such as funding/support one or more of the following entity types:
- Another PBC
- Association for public benefit
- Public endowment registered with the Registrar of Endowments
- Non-profit accredited higher education institution
- Public hospital
- Etc. 

The Companies Law provides for three types of PBFs, each with differences in funding sources, donors, and reporting obligations to the Registrar of Endowments:
- Family Foundation 
- Privately-Managed Foundation
- Publicly-Managed Foundation

## Cooperatives
Israeli law provides for the formation of non-profit cooperative societies for the purpose of cultivating "economy, independent assistance, and reciprocal assistance between persons having common economic interests, in order to effect an improvement in their living conditions." 
Requirements for forming a cooperative include:
- At least seven members (either natural persons or legal entities)
- Organizational purpose compliant with the aforementioned quote
- Unique name that is not prejudicial to the public or misleading as to the nature of the organization
  - Name must also include the words “cooperative” and “limited” at the end.
- Prohibition against profit-distribution 

## Public Endowments
A public endowment is a trust for which assets are dedicated to benefiting a particular public community or public aim. 
To establish a public endowment:
1. Provide a deed of endowment through which the endowment is established. The document will establish the creator of the endowment’s aims and goals. 
2. Appoint a trustee. The endowment is created once funds are transferred to the trustees. 
3. Register the endowment with the Registrar of Endowments within three months, providing the following details:
  - Assets
