To work in Israel, you will need a [B-1 work visa](http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ConsularServices/Pages/Visas.aspx). For people working in Israel longer than 30 days, an employment permit is also needed. Extensions are possible, and in the case of anyone with a work permit, necessary. 

To obtain a work permit, your employer must apply on your behalf with the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Labour. If approved, you will receive a letter of recommendation from the Ministry, with which you can apply for a work permit at your local Israeli consulate. Foreign workers will require a work visa for initial entry, and should apply for it in parallel with the work permit. 

To apply for a work visa, please provide the following:
- Passport
- Completed visa application
- Certificate of medical examination
- Certificate of good conduct
- Two passport-sized photos
- Signed document from employer stating their intent to hire the applicant

Foreigners may need to find local Israeli partners to establish a company. However a new incubator program pilot that began in 2017 may eventually help foreign entrepreneurs bypass that requirement (read more below).

# Innovation Visa
In 2017, the Israel Innovation Authority launched a pilot program aimed at attracting foreign talent to start “technologically innovative” companies in Israel. Foreigners aiming to establish companies must first apply to predesignated “launchpads” in Israel, which will host the project. If approved, they may then apply for the innovation visa. 

For more details about the application process, please refer to this [guide](http://innovation-visa.org.il/en/initiators.html) by the Israel Innovation Authority. 

# High Tech Work Visa (“HIT”)
As of early 2018, Israel offers a High Tech Work Visa (“HIT”) for eligible foreign workers (and accompanying spouses) to work at high-tech companies. Only visa exempt nationalities are eligible at this time. 

The initial work authorization is valid for one year and can be renewed for up to 63 months. 
The visa process is expedited and faster than the B-1 work visa process, taking around 6 days to complete. The salary for the position in question must be at least double the Israeli average: around 19,604 shekels per month.
