There is a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework on the protection of data and privacy in Israel. The relevant laws are the [Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, 5752-1992](https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic3_eng.htm); [Protection of Privacy Act, 5741-1981](http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=347462); and relevant guidance from the [Israel Privacy Protection Authority](https://www.gov.il/en/Departments/the_privacy_protection_authority). 

Although there is not yet any specific legislation addressing DLT or blockchain, certain rules on database management and data collection may apply. In Israel, the collection of personal data is conditioned on the consent of the subject in question. A request for consent from the user should include information on:
- Whether there is a legal requirement to provide the requested information
- The purpose of collecting the requested information
- Recipients of their information

Israeli data security law is quite comprehensive and in many cases, more stringent than the European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Scheme or similar laws.
