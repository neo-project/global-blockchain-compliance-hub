Raccoons, skunks, red squirrels, chipmunks and black bears are becoming more and more common in the areas we use for FOP. As they feed on human food, animals become accustomed to human presence and increasingly dependent on humans as a food source. As a result they become bolder, often posing a nuisance and at times a threat. Many of the above-mentioned species are currently experiencing a high incidence of rabies. Therefore, it is in your best interest to do your best to avoid animal encounters, both so that your food is not eaten or dam- aged and also so that the animals of northern New England do not come to rely on human food.

Remember that, while your efforts to maintain group safety by avoiding animal encounters are always paramount, you also have a responsibility to maintain the sites FOP visits. Every year this program introduces hundreds of people to the wilderness of Northern New England and, while animal encounters are rare, destruction of our wilderness areas is not. Always follow LNT principles and use common sense when taking steps to avoid animal encounters.

### AEA 101

- Animal encounters are most likely to happen in camp, at night, and in response to the scent of food, fuel, and toiletries. Reasonable and effective steps to avoid animal encounters include hanging food and toiletries at night away from camp and keeping fuel spills away from camp.
- Select the bearbag site and set up the lines as soon as you get into camp. This will minimize the safety risks associated with after-dark bearbagging expeditions and the environmental damage that often occurs in such situation.
- Food should be at least 100 feet from both your sleeping area and kitchen, ideally upwind. (Uncertain about how far is 'far enough'? Consider how close you would want your evening visitors to you and your FOPpers.)
- Bearbags should hang 10 feet from the ground and 8 feet from any tree trunk.
- Safety comes first, Benji! it is unsafe to be without food; it is unsafe to bearbag recklessly. "You better think about what you're doin'. You better think about the consequences of your actions." - Aretha
- Make sure that all the food, toothpaste, soap, tampons, sunscreen and garbage make it into the food bags and then up, into the air. Having a bearbag is only effective if it contains everything with any scent.

### The Bearbag

There are two basic strategies for hanging food - using one tree or two trees. Each of these methods can and should be used with some sort of pulley, which will reduce friction and give you mechanical advantage. Remember that these techniques describe the elusive Perfect Bearbag. In reality, you will need to be able to adapt these methods to the circumstances in which you find yourself.

All food, garbage and toiletries should be placed in stuff sacks, which are cinched closed and secured with a clove hitch around the neck of the bag. This will en- sure a degree of security of the food and will help prevent stuff sack drawstrings from pulling out. All the drawstrings are passed into a carabiner, which is clipped to the end of the rope. Ordinarily, a bearbag uses two carabiners - one for the stuff sacks and one for the pulley. A perfectly functional bearbag can be set up without carabiners if need be.

#### One Tree Food-Hang

(Images from Princeton's Outdoor Action program.)

- Select a tree with a branch at least 15 feet high that will be able to support the weight of your food 8 feet away from the trunk.
- Toss one end of the rope over the branch. You can tie a water bottle or a piece of wood to the end to give it enough weight for a good throw. BE CAREFUL that no one is standing where they might be hit by the weight or the rope; make sure that everyone is paying attention to the thrower so that they can get out of the way quickly if need be.
- If the rope or weight gets stuck, try alternating between shaking with slack and pulling.

- Once you have the rope hanging over the branch, it is set. Make a pulley before attaching the stuff sacks and hoisting them.

- Tie off the end of the rope with a friction wrap around the trunk of the bearbag tree or another nearby one.

#### Two Tree Food-Hang

1. Select two trees, approximately 20 feet apart, with branches at least 10 feet up. These branches need not be as strong as for a one tree bearbag, as most of the pull will be horizontal, against the trunk.
2. Throw one end of the rope over a branch of the first tree. Tie the rope off, using a friction wrap, around the trunk of the tree, making sure the rope is braced against the trunk rather than the branch.
3. Attach the stuff sacks to the rope about where the center point between the two trunks will be.
4. Throw the loose end of the rope over the branch of the second tree, and guide the rope around the trunk, so that when you pull to lift, you are not pulling down on the branch as much as you are pulling against the trunk.
5. Hoist the food bags up to hang between the two trees and tie off the end of the rope with a friction wrap around the trunk of the second tree.

#### One Tree, One Rope Pulley

1. Follow the steps for getting a rope over a tree branch above. Tug the rope into position so that one end of it (A-side) is hanging at hand-height. The section of the rope that is hanging on the other side of the branch will be called the B-side. Tie a figure-eight or butterfly knot in the B-side at about eye level. Attach a carabiner to the loop of the figure-eight or butterfly knot. This is your pulley.
2. Pass the end of the B-side of the rope through the carabiner. In the loop that is formed between one side of the knot and the carabiner, attach a second carabiner. This is where you will attach your stuff sacks.
3. With one person holding the second carabiner and the end of the B-side of the rope, have another person pull on the A-side end of the rope, thereby hoisting the pulley all the way up to the branch but not over it. Secure the A-side of the rope to a tree using a friction wrap.
4. Attach the stuff sacks to the second carabiner and hoist them up by pulling on the B-side of the rope. Pull until the loop closes and the stuff sacks are at the pulley. Secure the A-side of the rope to a tree using a friction wrap.

#### Two Trees, Two Ropes Pulley

1. Follow the steps for getting a rope over both the first and second tree branches above. Leave enough slack between the trees that most of the rope hangs at hand height.
2. Estimate where the middle of the rope will be when it is taut, keeping in mind that all the slack will be taken out of one side, not equally from both sides. At the mid-point, tie two small loops as close to each other as possible, using either a figure-eight or butterfly knot.
3. Attach one end of your second rope to one of the loops, tying it with a bowline. Take the other end of the rope and pass it through a carabiner attached to the second loop. Attach a carabiner to the large loop of rope that is created between the tied-off end and the first carabiner. This is where you will attach your stuff sacks.
4. With one person holding the second carabiner and the end of the second rope, have another person pull on the first rope so that it is as taut as possible between the two trees. Secure the end of the rope to the trunk using a friction warp.
5. Attach the stuff sacks to the second carabiner and hoist them up by pulling on the end of the second rope. Pull until the loop closes and the stuff sacks are at the pulley. Secure the second rope to a tree using a friction wrap.

#### Hoisting the Stuff Sacks

- Assign roles and talk through the procedure before beginning. Give plenty of direction while the procedure is underway.
- Two or three people help by pushing the bag up. They stand to the side of the bags (never underneath) to minimize the risk of the bags falling on them should something go wrong elsewhere.
- The rest of the group (or as many as needed) hoist the stuff sacks up, pulling the rope in the direction of the tree where it will be secured. It helps to have the pullers and the pushers working in unison, following one person's count.
- When the bag reaches the desired height, the pullers walk around the tree until there is enough friction to be secure.
- When lowering the bearbag, do not entirely remove the friction wrap initially. Instead, use the friction of the rope against the tree to slowly lower the stuff sacks in a controlled way.

### AEA 102

If you are staying at a campsite where there is a caretaker, always check in with him or her to see what steps you should take to avoid animal encounters, including whether or not he or she is all right with bearbagging.

Many established campsites now have some kind of food storage box that can be latched closed. If there is such a device at any campsite you are using, you should definitely use it! If there are other people using the site, make sure they do not want to use the food storage box.

In the rare instance where you find no trees suitable for a bearbag or you are in particularly precarious terrain, a modified bearbag can be created similar to the ridgeline of a tarp. Have the tallest member of your group tie a ridgeline between two trees with the bearbag rope. Before attaching the second side of the ridgeline, tie as many butterfly knots as possible along the length of the rope that will be pulled between the two trees. Finish attaching the ridgeline. Using carabiners, attach the stuff sacks to the butterfly knots, spreading the food as much as possible along the length of the line. If no carabiners are available, tie the stuff sacks on using bowlines. Do not attempt to secure all of the stuff stacks to one knot in the middle of the rope, as is done in the bearbag between two trees - this will result in sagging to the point of ineffectiveness.

In the even rarer instance that your group is either ill-equipped to do a food-hang or not capable for some reason, it is still worth getting all food, garbage and toiletries out of camp in order to avoid attracting animals. Try piling the stuff sacks and wrapping them with an extra personal tarp and/or placing pots on top so that a curious animal might be frightened away by the clatter of the pots.

Remember that spilled food and fuel are common attractors of animals. Do your best to minimize these and contain them in areas where animals will not bother the group.

Consider:

- Risk of losing food to animals
- Risk of animals harming group
- Risk of environmental damage
- Risks of injury, etc. in setting up a bearbag

Prioritize:

- The most immediate threat
- The most serious threat
- Making your presence less attractive to animals
