Non-Hong Kong residents may incorporate a local limited company in Hong Kong. Directors and shareholders can be of any nationality and must be 18 years or older. There are only requirements for the company secretary: If that secretary is an individual, they are required to reside in Hong Kong; if the secretary is a body corporate, their registered office or place of business must be in Hong Kong. If you do not often stay in Hong Kong or you are not familiar with the incorporation procedures, it is advisable for you to contact some local professional firms e.g. solicitors, accountancy or secretarial firms etc. for advice and/or appoint them to act on your behalf to set up a company in Hong Kong.
