Where the digital tokens involved in an ICO fall under the definition of “_securities_”, dealing in or advising on the digital tokens, or managing or marketing a fund investing in such digital tokens, may constitute a “regulated activity”. Parties engaging in a “_regulated activity_” are required to be licensed by or registered with the SFC irrespective of whether the parties involved are located in Hong Kong, so long as such business activities target the Hong Kong public.  

Where an ICO involves an offer to the Hong Kong public to acquire “securities” or participate in a CIS, registration or authorization requirements under the law may be triggered unless an exemption applies. Parties engaging in the secondary trading of such tokens (eg, on cryptocurrency exchanges) may also be subject to the SFC’s licensing and conduct requirements. Certain requirements relating to automated trading services and recognized exchange companies may be applicable to the business activities of cryptocurrency exchanges.’
