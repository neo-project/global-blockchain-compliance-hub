New York recognizes many business forms including corporations, limited liability companies, limited partnerships, sole proprietorships and general partnerships. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. For any particular venture, personal and business circumstances will dictate the business form of choice. The following items are needed to register in the state of New York: 
- Choose a name that follows New York's regulations and has not been registered by another organization. 
- File for your certificate of incorporation with the New York Department of State.
- Hold an organizational meeting to create bylaws.
- Request a Federal Employer Identification Number from the IRS.
- Apply for any business licenses or permits that you might need to operate in New York.
- Submit your organization's first report.
- Submit biennial reports to the Department of State.
- Pay incorporation fees. The fees in New York State vary depending on the specific type of corporation that you create. To form a professional service domestic corporation, for instance, you must pay a $125 filing fee plus a .05 percent tax for shares. The minimum tax on shares is $10 for a total minimum cost of $135.
