Even though there is no clear definition made by the Malta government about the smart contracts,  [in the consultation document](https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/FSDEI%20-%20DLT%20Regulation%20Document.pdf) issued by the Office of Prime Minister about the virtual currencies and Blockchain Technology, It is understood that the term “technology arrangement” was chosen to leave space in the future to cover not only Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies, but also other “arrangements” such as Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things.

[In the consultation document](https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/FSDEI%20-%20DLT%20Regulation%20Document.pdf) there is a short but very significant section; it is section “5.3 Legal Personality of Technology Arrangements” which reads:

‘Whilst some Technology Arrangements are owned by a corporate structure, other Technology Arrangements may not have such an ownership structure. This could result in the possibility of transacting on and with the Technology Arrangement without a proper ‘legal person’ as counterparty. The proposed TAS Bill will try to provide a solution to such a scenario and it is being proposed that certain Technology Arrangements will be able to register with the Registrar for Legal Persons in Malta and acquire legal personality upon satisfaction of a number of requirements.’
