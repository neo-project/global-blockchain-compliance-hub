* Sole Traders  
* Partnerships  
* Limited Liability Partnership  
* Companies  

### Sole Traders Overview
* Becoming a sole trader is the simplest way to get started in business. It is the most basic form of business structure and it is also relatively easy and inexpensive to start and maintain.
* Many sole traders choose to trade using their own name by registering as a Self-employed entity with the Income Tax Office and Employment Service. It is also possible to trade under a Business Name by registering one via Companies House prior to registering as Self-employed. 
* Information on filing for a business name can be found [here](https://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/new/companies-house)
* Sole traders retain complete control over the affairs of their business, including all assets and earnings. However, sole traders have unlimited liability and are consequently personally responsible for any losses their businesses may incur. It may also be harder to secure finance if registered as a sole trader
