## Non-Profit Organizations: ##

The Czech Republic is a civil law country with five primary forms of not-for-profit organizations (NPOs):
- Associations (spolek),
- Foundations (nadace),
- Funds (nadační fond),
- Registered institutes (ústav), and
- Social co-operatives (sociální družstvo).

The above legal entities (with exception of the social co-operative) are considered publicly beneficial taxpayers or not-for-profit organizations (NPOs) if their primary activity is not entrepreneurial (systematically pursuing profit making), as stated in their incorporation documents, statute, bylaws, or according to the decision of a public authority (Income Tax Law Article 17a(1)). [1]

### Association ###

In 2014, the Civil Code introduced a novel Czech term, "spolek" (which means "association") for the legal form previously known as "občanské sdružení" (which means the “Association of Citizens”) and belonging to the general category of corporations. The association is distinguished as a not-for-profit, non-commercial, corporate entity, which has a certain minimum number of members and should serve the interests of its members and/or enable its members to pursue certain public interests (Civil Code Article 217).
The Civil Code provides that an association must be established by and remain composed of at least three persons (Civil Code Article 214(1)), and that it cannot be established for a purpose that is explicitly commercial in the sense of engaging in entrepreneurship or focusing on profit-generating activity, unless such an activity is an auxiliary one and its purpose is to support the statutory purpose of the association or to enable more efficient use of its property. Any profit generated by such an auxiliary economic activity must be used exclusively for supporting statutory activities of the association including its administration expenses (Civil Code Article 217). The Civil Code also stipulates that a quorum of the highest governing body and all other bodies of an association shall be formed by an absolute majority of all members of the relevant body (Civil Code Article 252). By default, it is the assembly of all members of the association, which is its highest body, unless the association’s bylaws explicitly provide otherwise (Civil Code Article 246(2)).

### Foundation ###

A foundation’s endowment should have the potential to generate some income; this income is exempt from income tax when used for the publicly beneficial purpose of the foundation and not in violation of the law (Income Tax Law Article 19(1)(r)). Other assets of the foundation (including acquired donations) may be used to: pursue statutory purposes; provide financial support (such as grants) to third persons; cover costs of activities otherwise serving the purpose of the foundation; and cover administrative costs. The foundation must account for these expenditures separately (Civil Code Article 357).
The Board of Directors is the statutory body of the foundation entitled to make all necessary decisions. It must be comprised of at least three directors (Civil Code Article 362). The first directors are appointed by the founder or founder’s last will executor for a term of five years, unless otherwise determined in the founder's deed (incorporation document). The Board of Directors later maintains its composition according to the regulation provided in the founder's deed, usually by electing its own members (Civil Code Article 365). Foundations may engage in entrepreneurial activities, with the condition that such activities may only be auxiliary, and any profit generated must be used to support the main purpose for which the foundation was established. However, the foundation may not become a partner with unlimited liability in a commercial company (Civil Code Article 307).
Anyone may conclude a written contract with a foundation to take certain property into custody as its "associated fund" (přidružený fond), and to request from the foundation to use this property for a specified purpose related to the statutory purpose of the foundation. 

### Funds ###

Funds (nadační fond) are also asset-based organizations established by legal or natural persons to pursue a socially or economically beneficial purpose. The name of a fund must include the words "nadační fond."
Funds do not have a minimum endowment requirement. The assets of a fund consist of the founder's initial contribution and - later on - accepted donations, which are not required to yield further income. Funds are prohibited from pledging their assets or otherwise using their property to secure a debt. Any legal act aimed to such a use is considered invalid. On the other hand, the property of a fund may be alienated, if it is in accord with its purpose. It may also be used as a careful investment. Funds may be established for a limited period of time, or until their assets are fully consumed for the purpose defined in their incorporation document (Civil Code Articles 394-401). 

### Registered Institute ###

The registered institute (ústav) is established by private or public persons for the purpose of carrying out activities that are socially or economically beneficial and accessible to everyone, under conditions well defined in advance (Civil Code Articles 402-418). Like foundations, the registered institute is a non-membership-based organization operating to make use of its own personal and material components. It may not distribute its profits to affiliated persons such as members of governing and supervisory bodies and employees. The name of the registered institute must contain the words "zapsaný ústav" or the legal form acronym "z.ú." as a suffix (Civil Code Article 404).
Registered institutes may operate a business-oriented firm or be engaged in other auxiliary, profit-bearing economic activity under the condition that such activities do not jeopardize the quality, scope, and accessibility of the services provided in the framework of the institute's statutory activities. Any generated profit must be used exclusively to support the activity for which the registered institute has been established and to cover administration costs (Civil Code Article 403).  Foundations, funds, and registered institutes are exempt from property tax on buildings, and from real estate tax, if the building or land is used to advance their purposes.

## For-profit Organizations ##


The legislation available in Czech Republic provides a set of legal entities, similar with the ones available at the level of the European Union (EU). Czech Republic provides the following types of companies:

### Limited partnership

It is necessary that the associates in a general partnership to be natural persons.  The businessmen are equally liable for the company’s debts, which is calculated taken into account their contribution to the company’s share capital. Partners in a limited liability company are liable for company debts and obligations only up to the amount of capital they agreed to contribute to the company.

A director, who may be either a Czech natural person or a foreigner with a valid Czech residency permit, must be appointed to head the branch office.     The law according to which the branch's parent entity was founded also applies to the branch's internal dealings.
