### Non-Profit Company Forms

#### Foundations 
Foundations are a special collection of assets set aside for a purpose. The formation of the Liechtenstein foundation is effected through a foundation declaration. This deed requires the written form as well as the notarised signature of the founder. There is a minimum capital of CHF/EUR/USD 30,000 to start a Liechtenstein Foundation. Foundations need not register with the Public Registry. The Liechtenstein foundation is suitable for the safekeeping of assets and their transfer to heirs. 

#### Trusts
In Liechtenstein, the trust plays the role of the “trust settlement” or “family trust” of the Anglo-Saxon law. The Liechtenstein trust comes into being by means of a written agreement (trust deed) between the settlor and the trustee or else through a unilateral trust declaration and its acceptance, and then optionally entered into the Public Registry or merely registered with the District Court. The trust is designed to be a suitable vehicle for the long-term protection of assets or family assets as well as for estate planning. 

#### The Trust Enterprise
Liechtenstein has a form of company called the Trust Enterprise, which is a hybrid between a company and a foundation. It is a usefulful framework for an organization whose the purposes have not been fixed yet and a commercial purpose may be pursued later.
To form a Trust Enterprise, it suffices to submit the company’s articles of association and submit minimum founding capital of CHF/EUR/USD 30,000 cash or contributions in kind.

### Conclusion
Being member of the European Economic Area, Liechtenstein has access to European markets while staying out of more onerous European regulations. For this reason it has been a hub for company incorporation, with more registered companies than its population of 40,000. Liechtenstein has a custom union with Switzerland and the currency used by this state is the Swiss Franc.
