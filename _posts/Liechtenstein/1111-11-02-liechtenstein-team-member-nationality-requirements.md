According to [this site](https://www.companyformationliechtenstein.com/set-up-a-ag-in-liechtenstein), a local company director is required to form a company in Liechtenstein, however, nominee director services are available in Liechtenstein for hire though many local legal agencies.

Because the company registry of Liechtenstein only registers the data of the local manager, it increases enormously the discretion of the owner of the company. ([Source](http://crwwgroup.net/en/benefits-of-forming-a-company-in-liechtenstein/)).
