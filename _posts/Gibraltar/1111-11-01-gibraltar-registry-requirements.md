**The following are the necessary to establish a business in Gibraltar:** 

**Non-profit/for-profit company registry requirements**	

**The common forms of business entities in Gibraltar are:** [1]

* Sole Traders  
* Partnerships  
* Limited Liability Partnership  
* Companies  

**[Sole Traders Overview]** [2]
* Becoming a sole trader is the simplest way to get started in business. It is the most basic form of business structure and it is also relatively easy and inexpensive to start and maintain.
* Many sole traders choose to trade using their own name by registering as a Self-employed entity with the Income Tax Office and Employment Service. It is also possible to trade under a Business Name by registering one via Companies House prior to registering as Self-employed. 
* Information on filing for a business name can be found [here](https://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/new/companies-house)
* Sole traders retain complete control over the affairs of their business, including all assets and earnings. However, sole traders have unlimited liability and are consequently personally responsible for any losses their businesses may incur. It may also be harder to secure finance if registered as a sole trader   
     
**Partnerships Overview** 
* **Limited partnerships (LP)** (excluding Limited Liability Partnerships) are governed by the Limited Partnerships Act and consist of one or more persons called general partners, who shall be liable for all debts and obligations of the firm, and one or more persons to be called limited partners, who shall at the time of entering into such partnership contribute thereto a sum or sums as capital or property valued at a stated amount, and who shall not be liable for the debts or obligations of the firm beyond the amount so contributed. [3]

    * The term, if any, for which the partnership is entered into and the date of its commencement

      * A company is **limited by guarantee** if the liability of a company’s members is limited to such amount as the members may respectively thereby undertake to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of its being wound up
