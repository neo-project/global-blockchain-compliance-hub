**EU Privacy and Data Protection-Related Laws**
- As of May 25, 2018, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect in Gibraltar, automatically replacing the existing Data Protection act of 2004. As a member of the EU, EU's Privacy Laws apply to Gibraltar. Please refer to thie [EU Privacy Section of our website](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//europe/europe-privacy-and-data-protection.html).
-  Gibraltar privacy and data-protection law are now the same as other countries in the EU. Several articles have been written about the potential impact of the GDPR on blockchain including [here](https://medium.com/wearetheledger/the-blockchain-gdpr-paradox-fc51e663d047), [here](https://www.hlengage.com/_uploads/downloads/5425GuidetoblockchainV9FORWEB.pdf), [here](https://www.mindtree.com/blog/gdpr-stumbling-block-blockchain) and [here](https://martechtoday.com/can-blockchain-satisfy-gdprs-user-data-protection-requirements-targeted-ads-202600) as it is unknown how these new regulations will affect public blockchains
