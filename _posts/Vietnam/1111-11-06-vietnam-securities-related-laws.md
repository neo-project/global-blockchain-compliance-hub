In 2018, the State Securities Commission (SSC) is tasked with building the revised Securities Law, which should be submitted for the National Assembly’s review in the sixth meeting in October. The amendment of the securities law will demonstrate the policies and guidelines of the Government in restructuring financial markets, State-owned enterprises, creating favorable investment environment for all investors and enhance transparency for businesses. Government officials are aware of the need for a legal foundation to govern cryptocurrencies, but it is unclear if the new Securities Law will address this.
