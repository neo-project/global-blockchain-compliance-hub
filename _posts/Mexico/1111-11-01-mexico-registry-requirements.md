**The common forms of business entities in Mexico are:** 
- The Mexico Limited Liability Company (Sociedad de responsabilidad limitada) 
- The Mexico Export Processing Zone Company (Maquiladora company)
- The Mexican Stock Corporation (Sociedad Anonyma) 
- Branch Office 
- Representative Office 

**General Formation:** ([quoted from here)](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/2-554-9286?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true&comp=pluk&bhcp=1)
- These are the general steps for forming a company in Mexico:
  - **Name permit**: A permit from the Ministry of Economy must be secured to incorporate a Mexican entity (can be filed electronically) 
  - **Articles of incorporation**: The partners or shareholders must execute a public instrument formalising the company's articles of incorporation before a Mexican notary public or public broker. The founding partners or shareholders can grant powers of attorney to a Mexicon resident for that purpose. The company exists from the date of execution of the public instrument
  - **By-laws**: The articles of incorporation and bye-laws can be included in the same set of documents or be drafted separately. The main difference between them is that articles of incorporation contain the essential clauses for the creation of the company (that is, name, duration, domicile and share capital) and the bye-laws contain additional specific provisions relating to the structure and organisation of the entity
  - **Initial resolutions**: On incorporation, the shareholders or partners must adopt resolutions approving the initial issuance of shares, appointing the managers, officers and examiner (if applicable) and granting powers of attorney. These resolutions are normally included in the public instrument containing the articles of incorporation.
  - **Registration with the Public Registry of Commerce**: Once executed and issued, the public instrument must be filed with the Public Registry of Commerce.
  - **Other registrations**: The newly formed company must be registered as a federal taxpayer and with any relevant state tax offices. Additionally, a company that hires employees must register as an employer before the Mexican Social Security Institute. If foreign investors participate in the capital of the new company, the company must file for registration with the Foreign Investment Registry. Other registrations and authorisations may be required on a case-by-case basis (for example, registration for the IMMEX (maquila) programme, and importers or exporters registration).
