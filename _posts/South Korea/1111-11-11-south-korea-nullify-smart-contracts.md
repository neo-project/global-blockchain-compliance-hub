There is no standard procedure for nullifying smart contracts in the Korean Legal system, since there were found no term of smart contract.

- *Article 12 (Validity of Electronic Payment Transaction Contracts)*

(2) When any financial company or electronic financial business entity becomes unable to transmit the amount requested pursuant to paragraph (1), it or he/she shall return to the payer the amount received for electronic payment transactions. In such cases, when the failure to transmit the amount is caused by the negligence of the payer, the expenses incurred in relation to such transmission may be deducted.  <Amended by Act No. 11814, May 22, 2013>"

- *Article 14 (Withdrawal of Transaction Requests)*

“(1) Any user may withdraw his/her transaction request before the payment takes effect pursuant to each subparagraph of Article 13 (1).  <Amended by Act No. 12837, Oct. 15, 2014>
