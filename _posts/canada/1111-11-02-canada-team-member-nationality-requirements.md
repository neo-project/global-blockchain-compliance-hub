For non-Canadian residents, options to incorporate a business in Canada are limited. You can form a partnership with a Canadian resident of Canada, or you can form a corporation. If you form a corporation, there is a quota of Canadian citizens on your company board of directors, different depending on province. Ordinarily, at least 25 percent of the directors of a corporation must be resident Canadians. Corporations incorporated outside of Canada can operate in Canada by either opening a branch office or incorporating a subsidiary in Canada.
