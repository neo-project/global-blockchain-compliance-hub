[The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/) is the main law relevant to electronic privacy in Canada, which is worth reading in full.

The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada says, “Organizations covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)must obtain an individual's consent when they collect, use or disclose that individual's personal information. People have the right to access their personal information held by an organization. They also have the right to challenge its accuracy. Personal information can only be used for the purposes for which it was collected. If an organization is going to use it for another purpose, they must obtain consent again. Individuals should also be assured that their information will be protected by appropriate safeguards.” These rules are summarized in PIPEDA’s [fair information principles](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/p_principle/).

There have been no specific privacy legislation as of April 2014 on privacy on public online blockchains.
