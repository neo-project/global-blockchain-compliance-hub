Smart contracts are still not well-defined in Canadian law. In absence of clarifying legislation, it is questionable if smart contracts will be seen with the same legal force as traditional contracts. In late November 2017, [an article](http://www.slaw.ca/2017/11/27/beyond-the-bitcoin-crash-ontario-law-lays-a-foundation-for-enforceable-smart-contracts/) reported that Ontario jurisdiction laid a law which might be the foundation for the enforceability of smart arbitration clauses in smart contracts, so Canadian law is moving in the direction of incorporating smart contracts. Contact a Canadian blockchain legal expert for the most up-to-date information.
