### Foundation (stichting)
At this stage, Belgian law contains two kinds of foundations:
- Public utility foundations
- Private foundations

The first one is commonly used for serving a common/general interest in one of the seven categories as mentioned in the law (philanthropic, philosophical, religious, scientific, artistic, pedagogical or cultural nature) and shall be approved by a royal decree and approval of the AoA by the ministry of justice.

The second type, private foundations, are commonly used to support the development of a certain region, maintain cultural/historical heritage or in order to create a study fund for people’s children, etc. Overall, this form of foundations shall serve a purpose in which the founders do not have any interest.

A foundation is formed by means of a notarial deed. The appointment of a board and the articles of association (AoA) shall be part of this deed an include at least the following information:
-	Name of the foundation
-	Name(s) and place of the founder(s). In case a legal entity is the founder it shall mention the name, the type of entity and the place where it has its seat. In case a legal entity establishes the foundation, it is recommended that the board of this entity describes the reasons for establishing the foundation.
-	The place in Belgium where the foundation has its seat
-	The purpose of the foundation and how it aims to achieve its goals. Please note that the scope shall be carefully formulated, as it is not allowed to serve a purpose outside the foundation’s scope.
-	The way board members are appointed and dismissed
