### Taxation of cryptocurrencies
In Belgium gains derived from crypto assets are taxed as follows:
-	Professional/work related  Personal income tax
-	Investment  Gains are exempted from tax
-	Speculation  When in the view of the tax authorities someone takes extremely high risks in volatile markets (such as cryptocurrencies), which a ‘family father’ would not take. This is a rather vague description from the Belgian authorities and you easily get in a grey area, as there are no clear guidelines on what is speculative and what isn’t. In case it falls in this category, a tax rate of 33% applies.
In December 2017, the Service Public Federal Finances ruled that a student that developed an application for automatically trading bitcoins (a bot) was not considered as professional activities, but did fall into the ‘speculative’ category.
