A companyâ€™s internal management may be governed by:
- provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 that apply to the company - known as replaceable rules, or
- a constitution, or
- a combination of both.

#### Constitution
The constitution is a contract between:

- the company and each member
- the company and each director
- the company and the company secretary, and
- a member and each other member.

A company can adopt a constitution before or after registration. If it is adopted before registration, each member must agree (in writing) to the terms of the constitution. If a constitution is adopted after registration, the company must pass a special resolution to adopt the constitution.
A company can change or repeal its constitution by passing a special resolution. A special resolution needs at least 28 days notice for publicly listed companies and 21 days notice for other company types. For the resolution to pass, at least 75% of the votes cast must be in favour.
A company must provide a current copy of the constitution to any member who requests it within seven days. If a fee is charged, the constitution must be provided within seven days of payment.

#### Replaceable rules

Replaceable rules are in the Corporations Act and are a basic set of rules for managing your company. If a company doesn't want to have a constitution, they can use the replaceable rules instead.

Replaceable rules do not apply to a proprietary company if the same person is the sole director as well as the sole shareholder.
[Replaceable rules outlined](asic.gov.au/for-business/registering-a-company/steps-to-register-a-company/constitution-and-replaceable-rules/replaceable-rules-outlined/) details the rules outlined in the Corporations Act and which section they're in. The content in each of those sections applies as the replaceable rule. 
If a company wants to change or remove a replaceable rule, they will need to have a constitution that outlines the changes.
