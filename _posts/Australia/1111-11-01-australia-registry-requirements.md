The following business structures can be chosen from:

#### Sole trader: 
an individual operating as the sole person legally responsible for all aspects of the business. Like other structures, as a sole trader you can employ people to help you run your business. More information on Sole Trader can be found on the [Australian government’s Department of Industry, Innovation and Science website](https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Plan-and-Start/Start-your-business/Business-structure/Business-structures-and-types/Sole-trader) 

#### Company: 
a legal entity separate from its shareholders. Details on the differences between a company and a sole trader structure with respect to tax, liability and the legal obligations when employing people can be found on the [Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) website](https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Plan-and-Start/Start-your-business/Business-structure/Change-business-structure/Sole-trader-to-a-company/Difference-between-a-sole-trader-and-a-company).
Companies can also be registered as [Special Purpose Companies](http://asic.gov.au/for-business/registering-a-company/steps-to-register-a-company/special-purpose-companies/), which includes not for profit companies. Find more information on Special Purpose Companies on the [ASIC website](http://asic.gov.au/for-business/registering-a-company/steps-to-register-a-company/special-purpose-companies/).

#### Partnership: 
an association of people or entities running a business together but not as a company. More information on partnerships can be found on the [Australian government’s Department of Industry, Innovation and Science website] (https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Plan-and-Start/Start-your-business/Business-structure/Business-structures-and-types/Partnership)   

#### Trust: 
an entity that holds property or income for the benefit of others. More information on Trusts can be found on the [Australian government’s Department of Industry, Innovation and Science website](https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Plan-and-Start/Start-your-business/Business-structure/Business-structures-and-types/Trust) 

[The Help Me Decide Too]l (https://register.business.gov.au/helpmedecide/helpmedecide) is provided by the Australian government’s Department of Industry, Innovation and Science to help new business starters pick a business structure. 

Information on different business types such as home-based business and online business can be found on the [Australian government’s Department of Industry, Innovation and Science website] (https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Plan-and-Start/Start-your-business/Business-types-and-industries) 

 A company must be registered with ASIC. This can be done by contacting a private service provider, or by lodging a paper form directly with ASIC.

There are a number of private service providers (PSPs) that use software that has direct access to ASIC's systems. These PSPs can manage your company application for a fee. ASIC doesn't endorse any particular PSP.

You can register your company directly with ASIC by completing the [Form 201 – Application for registration as an Australian company](http://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/forms/forms-folder/201-application-for-registration-as-an-australian-company/) and mailing it to:
Australian Securities and Investments Commission
PO Box 4000
Gippsland Mail Centre VIC 3841

You must complete all information on the form and sign it. Include the fee (use a cheque or money order) when posting your application.

Once the application is processed, ASIC will:
1. give the company an ACN (Australian Company Number). More information on the ACN can be found on the [ASIC website](http://asic.gov.au/for-business/registering-a-company/steps-to-register-a-company/australian-company-numbers/#ABN) 
2. register the company
3. send you a certificate of registration
4. Give you a corporate [key](http://asic.gov.au/online-services/online-keys/corporate-key/) 

A [checklist for registering a company](http://asic.gov.au/for-business/registering-a-company/before-you-register-a-company/checklist-for-registering-a-company/)  is provided by ASIC 

A not for profit company is registered in the same way. However, in Australia, not for profit entities can be registered as a company, incorporated association, or as an Australian registered body. [More details about these structures can be found on the ASIC website](http://asic.gov.au/for-business/registering-a-company/steps-to-register-a-company/registering-not-for-profit-or-charitable-organisations/#registeringcompany).
