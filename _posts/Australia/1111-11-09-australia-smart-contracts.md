A legally enforceable smart contract must still meet all the traditional elements of a binding contract. Exhaustive information on contract law in Australia can be found on the [Monash University website](http://guides.lib.monash.edu/commercial-law/contract-law).
Any duress, undue influence or unconscionable dealings could render a smart contract void at law. Smart contracts are thus legally binding, but do not have a special definition in Australian law.
