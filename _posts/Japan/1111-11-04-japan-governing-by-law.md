As per article 94 of the Constitution of Japan, ‘Local public entities shall have the right to manage their property, affairs and administration and to enact their own regulations within law.” ([source](http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html)) Local administrative units are given a considerable amount of autonomy in legislating for business and commerce. Fortunately, it is possible to search for these laws online.
