Foreigners wanting to start a business of any type in the UK follow different procedures depending on their country of origin. UK residency (or citizenship) is not necessary to incorporate. Read [this guide](https://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/knowledge/articles/2009/02/2009-02-17-starting-a-business-a-guide-for-foreign-nationals-6/) for an overview of how to start a business in the UK as a foreign national.

  * The impact of Brexit on foreigners looking to start a business in the UK is not yet certain
  * Depending on your nationality, you may be required to apply for a work visa before setting up your business
  * Apply for the correct visa ahead of time (if this applies to you)
  * EU citizens do not currently need special permission to start a business in the UK
  * The only exception to the right of EEA nationals to live and work in other EEA members states involves nationals of Bulgaria and Romania
  * If you are Bulgarian or Romanian, you may have to apply for permission unless you qualify for an exemption
  * Check if you need a UK visa [here](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa)

In order to work in the UK, foreigners may need to obtain a visa.
