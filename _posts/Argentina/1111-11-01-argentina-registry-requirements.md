#### For-profit Registry Requirements

The most popular forms of companies in Argentina are Limited Liability Companies (Sociedad Limitada), Stock Corporations (Sociedad Anomina), and Branches of Foreign Companies. Some comparisons of the three are below:
- LLCs require ARS$12,000 in minimum paid-up capital while stock corporations require AR$ 100,000 (US$3500), while Branches require no paid-up capital.
- For LLCs of Stock Corporations, the majority of the company’s administrators must live in Argentina. Branches don’t require a board of directors or any other officers.

- Branches are that the foreign parent company of a branch is fully liable for the branch’s debts and the branch cannot raise capital from third parties. Corporations and Limited Liability Companies have limited liability and may offer shares publicly to get funding. 

A comparison of the differences and requirements between the three can be found [here](https://www.healyconsultants.com/argentina-company-registration/setup-llc/) or [here](http://cspabogados.com.ar/en/how-to-set-up-a-company-in-argentina/).

#### Non-profit Registry Requirements

Non-profits in Argentina may be Foundations or Civil Associations. The difference is that in a Foundation, the objectives of the founders must be respected without change, whereas in civil associations, the objectives may change with a vote from the directors.

To start a Foundation or Civil Association in Argentina, you must have a legal address in Argentina. You must provide a statute with the name for your foundation, its precise goals, its initial and future capital, its domicile and territorial scope, its term, internal organization, board of directors and meeting régime, operational rules, the closing date of the accounting period each year, rules for reform of the foundation if necessary, and dissolution requirements. You can find the form for application on the [Ministry of Justice website (in Spanish)](https://www2.jus.gov.ar/igj-formularios/Default.aspx). 

A foundation must have at least three directors on its board, which may be permanent or temporary, appointed by the founders.

You must deposit your initial capital in the Argentine National Bank (AR$80,000 for a Foundation and AR$1000 for a civil association). You may optionally found your organization with non-monetary contributions, which may be included in an inventory in the bank and certified by a public accountant.

The founder should then go to a public notary with the founding statues and the founding capital to incorporate the organization. The notarized founding deed should be brought with the proof of accounting capital contribution. After doing this, the founder will able to register the organization in the Public Registry.
