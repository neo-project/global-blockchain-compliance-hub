Blockchain is rather popular in Argentina. Many Argentines became interested in Bitcoin early as [a hedge against inflation](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com.hk/&httpsredir=1&article=1017&context=international_immersion_program_papers), and in 2018, Argentina is installing 4000 bitcoin ATMs around the country.

However, regulation is gaining in Argentina. Possibly the most imporatntly, there is a new regulation in the recent [2018 Argentine tax reform](http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/305000-309999/305262/norma.htm) which would impose a 15% tax on profits obtained in digital currency operations, taxing them as securities, despite [opposition by the bitcoiner community](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2081193-la-comunidad-bitcoin-dice-que-la-reforma-tributaria-es-confiscatoria-y-cortoplacista).
([Source](http://www.mondaq.com/Argentina/x/673682/tax+authorities/Argentina+introduces+a+large+Tax+Reform)) Argentina is also planning regulation to extend money-laundering laws to blockchain, requiring service providers such as exchanges, wallets, and brokers to report suspicious activity to the authorities.

Currently as of June 2018, ICOs in general are not yet subject to specific regulation in Argentina. A [report by the Argentine National Securities Commission (CNV - note, in Spanish)](http://www.cnv.gob.ar/web/secciones/prensa/comunicados.aspx?id=208) in December 2018 noted that in certain cases tokens from ICOs can be considered negotiable securities and their stakeholders could be subject to criminal and administrative responsibilities, however, the report itself also stipulated that the current regulatory framework puts no specific regulation on ICOs.
