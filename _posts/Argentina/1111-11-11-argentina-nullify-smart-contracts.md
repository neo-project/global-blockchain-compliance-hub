The draft of the new Argentine Data Protection Law states that
"The owner of the data shall have the right not to be the subject of a decision based on only in automated data processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects on him or affects him significantly in a similar way.
However, the owner of the data may not exercise the right referred to in the preceding paragraph if the
decision:
 - is necessary for the conclusion or execution of a contract between the owner of the
data and a data controller;
 - It is authorized by law;
 - It is based on express consent.

Under this interpretation it would seem that smart contracts, if explicitly legally consented to, would be valid. However, smart contracts that affect a person legally that are not consented to would not be valid. Note that this Draft Bill has not yet passed in the Argentine Congress as of June 29, 2018.
