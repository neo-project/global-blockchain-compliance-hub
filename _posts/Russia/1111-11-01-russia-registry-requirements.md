The procedures for establishing a legal entity in Russia are well-developed and are regulated by the Russian Federation Civil Code and by additional laws.

## Non-profit organisation

**Non-profit organisation (NPO)** — is an organisation, whose main goal of the activities isn’t to make a profit and that does not divide profits between the employees. Non-profit organisations can be created for social, charity, cultural, educational, scientific and government purposes. Non-profit organisations in Russia are associations, unions, institutions, non-profit partnerships, autonomous non-profit organisations, community-based organisations, consumers’ cooperatives, charities, and some other forms of organisations. According to the Russian legislation, all NPOs are divided into two groups: corporations and unitary organisations. Corporations are organisations whose employees have the right to fully participate in their activities and form a supreme governing body.

 
Organisations, whose founders do not become the participants and do not obtain the membership rights, are unitary organisations.
NPOs can have civil rights that correlate with the aims of the activities that are described in the company documents and can be responsible for these activities.

 
The activities of some of the NPO forms (all associations) are allowed without a state registration; however, in this case the organisation cannot obtain the legal entity status, it cannot own or on the basis of property law any separate property. Organisations can obtain property and non-property rights, perform duties (be a part of the civil turnover, conduct business activities), be a claimant and defendant in court only if they have the legal entity status.

 
Russian public associations are founded on their rules which must state the name and objectives, the structure and the type of public association, the conditions of becoming members or being withdrawn (only in case of the public associations with membership), the modality of appointing the boards and the board’s members, the procedure of amending the rules and other documents, the source of funds, the procedure of reorganization and liquidation.

The following **documents** must be registered no later than three months from the meeting where the decision of establishment was taken: 

  - an application for registration of the Russian NGO
  - the charter of the public association in three copies
  - the minutes of the meeting where the decision of foundation was taken
  - information regarding the founders
  - the proof of payment of the registration fees 
  - the details regarding the address of the governing body of the public association which is used for contacting.


All NPO must have an autonomous balance sheet, a bank account, be on the books of the tax and other public bodies of accounting and control (more info on Federal Tax Service Website).

## For-Profit Company
 
Foreign investor may set up (or register) a Russian legal entity in the form of **limited liability company (LLC)**, **joint-stock company (PJSC, which can be private or public)** or **partnership**.


Joint stock and limited liability companies are forms that are most frequently used by foreign investors to enter the Russian market.
Joint-stock and limited liability companies are governed by separate federal laws: Federal Law No. 14-FZ of 8 February 1998 “On Limited Liability Companies” and Federal Law No. 208-FZ of 26 December 1995 “On Joint-Stock Companies”. However, the registration process and requirements are similar.

The other way is to register a **representative office** or **branch office of a foreign company in Russia**.

## 1.1 Russian Legal Entities: Limited Liability Company, Joint-Stock Company, Partnership

Limited Liablility Company (LLC) and Public/Private Joint Stock Companies (PJSC) are Russian legal entities. They may conduct any form of commercial activity, provided it is not prohibited by the Russian legislation. For conducting any licensed type of activity it is necessary to obtain license.


**Partnership** is a form of legal entity similar to limited liability company. A full partnership is similar to the American general partnership, in which the partners bear (full) joint and some liability for the partnership’s obligations. A participant in a full partnership may not be a full partner in any other partnership. A limited partnership, which is closer to the European kommandit type of partnership, has both full partners and partners whose liability is limited to their contributions. A full partner in a limited partnership may not be a full partner in another partnership, and their liability is the same as for full partners as described above. Partnerships under Russian law are generally regarded as legal entities and taxed accordingly. 
Please refer to Limited Liability Company requirements and procedures.

Registration is done by the Tax authorities, which keep the United State Register.

Company also shall be registered with State Committee for Statistics and three non-budgetary funds (Pension fund, Obligatory Medical Security Fund and Social Security Fund).

  - Registration duty is 2000 rubles (~34 USD).
  - Minimum authorized capital for LLC and PJSC is 10,000 rubles (~US$170). Authorized capital is divided into shares/units which represent rights and obligations of a shareholder/participant in accordance with their participations in the authorized capital.
The number of shareholders/participants in PJSC/LLC can not exceed 50. Any Russian and foreign companies and persons may be founders and shareholder in any number of Russian companies. The company may be established by a single founder, as long as the founder is not a company owned by a single legal entity or individual.
  - Registration at State Committee for Statistics, which amount in general to no more than ~80 USD.
  - There are also charges for registration of company’s seal; however, company seals are no longer a legal requirement in Russia following a change in the law in 2015, but many Russian businesses still have seals. The cost for producing one is R500 (US$9). 


**Limited Liability Company** or **Private Joint Stock Company** can be founded by an individual (Russian or foreign) or by a legal entity; such cases are called Sole ownership. The founding document at Sole ownership company is a Charter. Such company doesn’t have some management bodies such as General Meeting of the Founders. There is no Board of Directors. All the decisions are taken by the sole founder. Legislative requirements on calling of the general meetings, and other procedural requirements do not apply to such company. The management of the company is done by issue of written decisions of the founder. If the founder is also a General Director in the company, the decisions are made by issuance of orders. At the same time such company is a separate legal entity, its assets are legally isolated from the assets of the founder.
