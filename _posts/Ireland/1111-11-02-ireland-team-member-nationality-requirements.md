[This page](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types_of_employment/self_employment/coming_to_set_up_a_business_in_ireland.html) details team member nationality requirements for people setting up businesses in Ireland.

European Economic Area (EEA) or Swiss citizens do not need permission to establish a business in Ireland and do not require a visa to visit, travel to, live, or work in Ireland.

Your company must have a Director who is resident in the EEA, or you must take out a ‘[Section 137 Revenue Bond](https://www.companyformations.ie/company-secretarial/irish-non-resident-director-bond/)’ for 2 years. ([Source](https://www.companyformations.ie/company-formations/non-resident-companies/))

Non EEA/Swiss citizens can also apply for one of two scenes to set up businesses in Ireland: Immigrant Investor Programme for those investing in Ireland (less relevant) and the Start-up Entrepreneur Programme (STEP). Those applying under the STEP must have their company be less than 5 years old and headquartered and controlled in Ireland.
