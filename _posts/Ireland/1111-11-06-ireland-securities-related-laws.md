No blockchain is legal tender in Europe, including Ireland.

If an ICO falls under securities regulation [this document](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-157-828_ico_statement_firms.pdf) details the ergulations that it may have to comply with, as listed below.

* The Prospectus Directive: the securities token will subject to publication of a prospectus which must be approved before the token can be offered.
* The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID): if the firm 1) provides services to clients around financial instruments 2) the organized trading of financial instruments, it will be subject to MiFID regulations. The MiFID is a large suite of regulations designed to protect investors in financial markets. A detailed summary of MiFID requirements can be found [here](https://www.fca.org.uk/mifid-ii/1-overview). It is recommend to consult with a lawyer if your firm’s activities seem to fall under MiFID’s regulation.
* Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive: “The Directive requires firms to carry out due diligence on customers and to have in place appropriate record-keeping and other internal procedures. Firms have an obligation to report any suspicious activity and to co-operate with any investigations by relevant public authorities.”
* Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive: This directive regulates alternative investment fund managers. A small number of blockchain projects may be considered alternative investment funds. If this applies to your firm, see [this source](http://www.matheson.com/images/uploads/publications/AIFMD_Factsheet_Overview.pdf) for detail on the regulations.
