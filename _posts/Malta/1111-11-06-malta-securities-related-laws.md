At the moment, in Malta, the cryptocurrency market is mostly unregulated although some clarifications have been gained from the regulatory authorities.

Currently, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not considered as regulated instruments under Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and any company that handles cryptocurrencies are not required to undergo any form of licensing process with the Malta Financial Services Agency (MFSA)

The only exception to this rule is if the coin can be considered as an investment instrument under the Investment Services Act, and if they did, they would trigger the obligations of the act.

The government has also taken steps to warn investors about the possible risks associated with crowdfunding and ICOs, as well as securities fraud. Because transactions involving cryptocurrencies cannot be reversed, as well as the fact that they are anonymous, means that there are opportunities for fraudsters to strike. MFSA also [warned](https://www.fi.ee/public/hoiatusteated/Shtern_Group_draft_english.pdf) against certain activies and service providers within the blockchain industry. 

The Maltese government has taken several steps to regulate these new industries as well as to propose a framework that will not only protect investors, but that will support the evolution and development of the sector.
 
Between the 23rd of October and the 17th of November 2017, the Maltese government in collaboration with the MFSA launched a period of public consultation that involved the input of 53 different local and international stakeholders. During this time, the MFSA aimed to gather information and feedback on the ICO and cryptocurrency industry as well as some of its propositions for regulations.
 
In February 2018, the Government [published](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2018/04/132677-malta-approves-three-pro-crypto-bills-just-another-red-carpet-for-corruption/) its plans to table three bills that would seek to provide comprehensive regulation for ICOs, virtual currencies and blockchain technology.

The paper states that new authority will be created, known as the Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA) which will oversee the certification of blockchain platforms and cryptocurrencies, as well as the functioning of ICOs.
 
This new authority will act as a regulator and a watchdog over ICOs and will also function as a consultative body that will be tasked with promoting government policy and protecting the reputation of the jurisdiction.
 
This board will be entirely responsible for the registration and certification of Technology Service Providers regarding the TAS Bill, and it will function as the National Competent Authority.
 
The MDIA will also appoint inspectors and impose administrative penalties as well as single public statements amongst other powers that it will be given.
 
The second bill will pertain to virtual currencies, and in particular, it will provide stringent guidance and regulation for Initial Coin Offerings and other services related to VCs.
 
The bill will also impact brokers, exchanges, wallet providers, investment advisors, market makers, and asset managers, that deal with cryptocurrency. Certain ICOs can fall within the scope of investment services regulations, and therefore the MFSA will roll out a proposed Financial Instruments Test which will ascertain whether the ICO or cryptocurrency could be considered as a financial instrument that would fall under the investment services regulations or whether it will fall under the scope of the VC Bill.
 
The Financial Instruments Test will be made applicable to persons or companies that are offering ICOs conducted in Malta to determine whether it should fall under the scope of the MiFID.
 
This test will also apply to individuals that provide services or activities regarding non-classified VCs, and the analysis will provide a much-needed degree of legal certainty and clarification regarding the particular asset.
 
The bill will create the first legal framework of its type, in any global jurisdiction that will govern ICOs while providing a regulatory framework which applies to service providers.
ICOs that relate to VCs yet do not qualify as a financial instrument will then be set transparency requirements and a standardised list of information which must be provided in the whitepaper.
 
Those individuals that provide such services will be required to abide by licensing requirements as well as applicable ongoing obligations. The MFSA will also have the right to investigate and if necessary, suspend and ICO or the trading of a VC on any exchange or platform.
 
The third bill will be the TAS Bill. It will seek to regulate Technology Service Providers, and it will also certify and verify Technology Arrangements as long as they feature an administrator that has been registered with the MIDA.
