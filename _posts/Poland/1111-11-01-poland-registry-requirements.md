#### How to set up a for-profit limited company.
The Polish Government has a [guide](https://www.biznes.gov.pl/en/przedsiebiorcy/biznes-w-polsce/zakladam-firme) on how to start a company in Poland. In it, it lays out a series of steps to register a business in Poland. All commercial businesses except for small ones should register.

All company registrations can be done by proxy, either in paper on online. [Here](https://www.biznes.gov.pl/przedsiebiorcy/biznes-w-polsce/zakladam-firme/rejestracja-dzialalnosci) are official Polish guides on how to register a Sole Proprietorship, Civil Law Partnership, LLC, General Partnership, Limited Partnership, Joint-Stock Company or Limited Joint-Stock Company in Poland. 

You need to set up a business bank account in Poland and obtain a registered office on Poland. After registering your company you also need to register for taxes.
After this process, you will obtain two numbers, the Tax Identification Number (NIP) and the registration and statistical number (REGON) for identification and reporting purposes that identify you as a registered company.

### The Registration Process for a LLC

### Registering a Nonprofit
There are two types of nonprofits in Poland, *associations* and *foundations*. According to [this source](http://www.bridgewest.eu/article/register-non-profit-organization-poland), "*associations* are organizations between several members that are joined together by a non-profit objective. This type of non-profit organization is supervised by the supervising agencies that have the power to verify its activities, demand copies of the acts, require explanations from the association’s authorities” while “A *foundation* opened in Poland is created with no membership for pursuing non-profit objectives. These objectives may be protection of the historical landmarks, advancement of health, education and technology, culture, literacy, social services and others.”

In order to register an association, the founding committee must deposit the statute, a list with all the founders and their details, the address of the temporary seat and the procedure under which the founding committee was elected.
