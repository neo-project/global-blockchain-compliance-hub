There are no real bylaw requirements for Poland. An International Bar Association Guide on Polish Shareholder Agreements note that “Usually, by-laws in Poland are in standard formats due to the fact that most companies do not require any specific regulation thereof. However, in case there is a need for more complex regulation of by-laws, tailor-drafting is common.” ([Source](https://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=7F83E985-659E-4FFE-825E-7F9B98365EF6))
