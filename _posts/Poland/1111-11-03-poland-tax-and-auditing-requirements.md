### Tax Requirements
A corporation of limited joint stock partnership is tax resident in Poland if its registered seat or management is in Poland. Residents are taxed on worldwide income while non-Polish resident firms are taxed only on Polish-sourced income. 

The Polish Corporate Tax Rate is 19% (with a lower rate of 15% for small businesses). There is a Capital Gains Tax of 19%, and losses may be carried forward for five years and deducted from taxable income. However, no more than 50% of the total loss incurred can be deducted in a given year. There is also a withholding tax of 19% on dividends and 20% on interest, but dividends received by a Polish resident company from another company in the EU/EEA or Switzerland are exempt from tax depending on some requirements. Note that a tax deduction ranging from 100% to 150% of qualifying expenses incurred for R&D activities may be available. A one-time depreciation write- off up to EUR 50,000 also may be available for small and start-up taxpayers.
