A foreign individuals may have authorization to work or conduct business in Poland, but still may find it difficult to set up a company. [This article](https://www.wroclaw.pl/en/how-to-set-up-company-guide-for-foreign-residents) cites the experience of Oksana Kartavtseva, who studied and worked in Poland for over five years, but then found that she did not have the legal right to start a company, only the right of employment or studies. These people may become managers of Polish companies but not start them. Legal advisor Tomasz Czapczyński notes that, "by principle, people without the right to conduct business in the territory of the Republic of Poland and are (still) entitled to operate a limited partnership, limited joint-stock company, limited liability company or joint-stock company can only act as partners in such companies, which entails using the equity interests only without the right to represent the company and conduct operations. This law means that as a foreign national you can share in the company's profits without being able to perform activities on its behalf, e.g. based on a manager's contract."

It is highly recommended for foreigners who wish to set up companies in Poland to register the company online, using a standard template available in the [Government S24 system (Link In Polish)](https://ems.ms.gov.pl/), as they may not have the proper authorization to reside in Poland to set up the company. The registration fee is 350 PLN.
