For EU regulation, please visit [Europe: Who Bears Final Responsibility and Liability](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//europe/europe-final-liability.html). 

There is currently no legal framework in Denmark  specifically tailored for smart contracts. Given the absence of explicit regulations regarding smart contracts, who bears final responsibility/liability if something goes wrong will most likely have to follow [Danish contract law](http://www.mondaq.com/x/169876/Contract+Law/The+Danish+Contracts+Act) and be determined on a case by case basis.
