Any Nordic or EU/EEA citizen can start a business in Denmark. If you are from outside the Nordic countries, EU/EEA, or Switzerland, you have to apply for a residence and work permit before arriving in Denmark. There are many programs, such as “The Positive List,” “The Pay Limit Scheme,” “Researchers and Guest Researchers Program,” and “Start-up Denmark,” which can all be found [here](https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB).

How to Apply for Residence and Work Permits:
  * Applications for work and residence permits are typically submitted to a Danish diplomatic mission in your home country
  * The application process typically takes 1-3 months
  * The application form and guidelines can be found [here](https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB)
  * You must either submit your application in person or appear in person to have your biometric features recorded no later than 14 days after application submission
  * If you already legally reside in Denmark, you can submit your application [here](https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB), at a Danish police station, or in the Citizen Centre of the Danish Agency for International Recruitment and Integration

  * After arriving in Denmark, you must register your address in the Civil Registration System (CPR) to receive a Civil Registration number (CPR number)
