For EU regulation, please visit [Europe: Can Smart Contracts be Nullified?](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//europe/europe-nullify-smart-contracts.html).

There is currently no legal framework in Denmark specifically tailored for smart contracts, including their nullification.
