Denmark recognizes many business forms including sole proprietorship (enkelmandsvirksomhed), partnership (interessentskab-I/S), entrepreneurial limited company (ivaerksaetterselskab-IVS), and limited company (anpartsselskab-ApS). Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. For any particular venture, personal and business circumstances will dictated the business form of choice. Registering a business in Denmark is very easy and can be done online in 15 minutes.

General Steps:
  * Go to the [Start virksomhed website](https://indberet.virk.dk/myndigheder/stat/ERST/Start_virksomhed?nm_extag=Link%3D%2Cforside%2Cmest-anvendte-start-virksomhed%2C) (in Danish), use your NemID code, and enter in basic information—it is free to start a sole proprietorship
  * Individuals all have a CPR (Central Personal Registration number), and when you register a business you will automatically get a CVR number (Central Virksomhed Registration number)
  *  During registration, you must choose which type of company you are registering

Sole Proprietorship (Enkelmandsvirksomhed):
  * Go to [Virk.dk](https://indberet.virk.dk/) and find “Start Virksomhed”
  * Fill in personal information, type of business, if you have employees, in what area you work
  * Once you click send, all information is sent to relevant authorities and you will soon receive your CVR number

Partnership (Interessentskab-I/S)
  * Same steps as a sole proprietorship—go to Virk.dk to register
  * Since a partnership has more than one owner, all owners must fill in their personal information on the application form and all are equally liable for any debt in the company
  
Limited Company (Anpartsselskab-ApS)
  * This is a separate legal entity which requires 50,000 DKK in seed capital
  * It can be registered yourself or using an accountant/lawyer for 2-3,000 DKK
  * Go to Virk.dk to register

Entrepreneurial Limited Company (Ivaerksaetterselskab-IVS)
  * A form of limited company that can be created for 1 DKK
  * Must have a business account at a bank as well as a few other documents (can be prepared by an accountant or lawyer for 2-3,000 DKK)
  * Go to Virk.dk to register

Non-Profit Registration
  * Danish non-profits work within a legislative framework made up of various separate acts, among others “Lov om offentlige indsamlinger” (legislation on public fundraising)
  * Charitable and non-profit organizations must be approved pursuant to s. 8A and s. 12(3) of the Danish Tax Assessment Act--this is to determine if the applying organization has an adequate level of public support
  * Approved organizations are able to apply for VAT refunds and tax relief
