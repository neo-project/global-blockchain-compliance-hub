For EU specific regulations, please visit [Europe: Securities Related Laws](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//europe/europe-securities-related-laws.html).

Cryptocurrencies remain unregulated in Denmark. The Danish FSA has pointed out that certain tokens increasingly resemble financial instruments, which could cause them to fall within the scope of regulation. However, this is decided on a case by case basis. The way ICOs are structured or the way investments in them take place can potentially be regulated, and the FSA advises businesses involved in ICOs and cryptocurrencies to follow relevant EU laws. Whether an ICO is or is not regulated will always be subject to an individual assessment by the Danish FSA.
