When starting a company in Denmark, a certain set of governing laws/bylaws set forth between members and managers of a business need to be created. A memorandum of association, articles of association, and a registration form setting out the company’s details must be submitted to the [Danish Business Authority](https://danishbusinessauthority.dk/). The registration procedure takes 1-3 days using the online system or up to 8 weeks or more through paper registration. If the promoter is a non-Danish legal entity, the registration cannot be made using online registration.

Memorandum of Association:
  * Names, addresses, and CVR numbers of the promoters
  * Subscription price of the shares
  * Time limits for subscribing and paying for shares
  * From which date formation takes legal effect
  * From which date formation takes effect for accounting purposes
  * Whether the limited liability company must pay the initial expenses and, if so, the estimated amount of such expenses
  * Other (if relevant):
       * Special rights or benefits accruing to the promoters or others
       * Any agreement entered into with the promoters or others that may impose a major financial obligation on the company
       * That shares may be subscribed against contribution of assets other than cash
       * That the annual report of the company is not to be audited if the company qualifies for an audit exemption under the Danish Financial Statements Act or any other statute
       * The amount of the subscribed share capital that is paid up at the date of formation

Articles of Association:
  * Company name and any secondary name(s)
  * Company object(s)
  * Amount of share capital and the number or nominal value of the shares
  * The rights attached to the shares
  * The company’s governing bodies
  * Notice of general meetings
  * The company’s financial year
