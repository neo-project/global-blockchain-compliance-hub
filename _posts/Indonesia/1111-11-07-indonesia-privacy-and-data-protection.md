The protection of personal data is the main responsibility of the Ministry of Communication and Informatics (MOCI). Apart from that MOCI is also responsible to engage as the main regulatory authority and as the supervisor of data protection activities in Indonesia. The name of the legislation governing data protection of citizens falls under Law No. 11 of 2008 regarding Electronic Information and Transactions, as amended by Law No. 19 of 2016.
 
MOCI Regulation 20 requires that the transfer of data overseas to be done through coordination with the Minister of Communication and Informatics (MOCI). Coordination entails reporting the plan to transfer the personal data including the destination, receiving party, data and reason of transfer. Unfortunately, MOCI Regulation 20 does not set out a specific procedure to implement the coordination with the MOCI.

-Health: [Article 57 of Law No 36 of 2009](http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/91185/105616/F-1979234557/IDN91185%20IDN.pdf) stipulates confidentiality of all health related data gathered by healthcare providers
