Even though there is great uncertainty surrounding Smart Contracts in Indonesia, as per the Indonesian Law, they can be considered to lie under the [Electronic Information and Transaction Law](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/indonesian-electronic-information-and-80914/) since they are legal actions executed by using computer, computer network, or other electronic media. Also, there is currently no specific regulation guaranteeing liabilities and responsibilities of parties in a smart contract.
 
In the case that blockchain based smart contracts were made legal, it is important to note that as per Indonesian Civil Code, a contract is deemed legal if it meets the following four conditions:
-the consent of the parties,

-the legal capacity to enter into an obligation,

-a specific subject matter, and

-a permitted cause.
