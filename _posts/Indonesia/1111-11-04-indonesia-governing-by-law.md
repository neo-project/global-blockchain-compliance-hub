The Company Law specifies a two-tier board model stating that there are three organs in a company comprising the:
- General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS) 
- The Board Of Commissioners (BOC) which corresponds to the supervisory board
- The Board Of Directors (BOD) [OECD]( https://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/BoardMemberNominationElection2012.pdf). 

The key role of the board lies in the nomination and remuneration process of commissioners and directors. It also includes ensuring disclosure of qualifications of board members and providing orientation programmes for board members on their fiduciary duties. Apart from that, as defined in bylaws their duties must also extend to defining the tenure of commissioners, implementation of succession planning policies and evaluating performance of the company [Thomson Reuters Practical Law]( https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/8-506-7779?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true&comp=pluk&bhcp=1)
