The [Indonesia Stock Exchange](www.idx.co.id) is the sole surviving securities market in Indonesia. The main securities traded on the IDX are shares (including rights) and bonds. The securities market is regulated by [Financial Services Authority or OJK](www.ojk.go.id). Apart from which there are three self-governing bodies: the  [Indonesia Stock Exchange](www.idx.co.id), [Indonesian Central Securities Depository](www.ksei.co.id) and [Indonesian Clearing and Guarantee Corporation](www.kpei.co.id). The following legislations are applicable to the equity markets/exchanges:
-Indonesian Capital Markets Law (Law No. 8 of 1995 on Capital Markets)
-Financial Services Authority Act 2011 (Law No. 21 of 2011 on Financial Services Authority)
-OJK rules and regulations (including regulations issued previously by Bapepam-LK)
-IDX rules on listing, trading, and membership requirements
-KSEI regulations
-KPEI regulations
 
While there is much flux on whether to consider cryptocurrency as a security or a commodity, given that BAPPEBTI in June 2018 announced that it will allow all cryptocurrency trading on futures exchanges as a commodity, it is worth considering commodity exchange laws in Indonesia.

Trading in ICDX is settled, guarantee and cleared by Indonesia Clearing House (ICH).

As per the law, in granting of a business license of Futures Exchange, the exchange must be established by 11 limited liability companies after granting of license by the Head of Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (COFTRA) in Indonesia.
