## NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION
 
There are three different types of non-profit organizations in Indonesia – Yayasan (foundation), Perkumpulan (Association) and Lembaga (Institute). The definitions, governing laws, structures and steps to set up each are described below:

Governed under Law Number 28 (2004), a Yayasan is defined as a non-membership legal entity, established based on the separation of assets, and intended as a vehicle for attaining certain purposes in the social, religious, or humanitarian fields. Law 16/2001 acknowledges the right of foreigners to establish yayasan. However, as per Law 17 (2013), foreign individuals and Indonesian party, must have initial assets of IDR 1 Billion, while a Foundation established by foreign entity must have initial assets of IDR 100 Billion (1 USD = IDR 14,463 as on July 25, 2018). Also, a foreign member of the board of the foundation must hold a working permit, [IMTA](http://www.pnbimmigrationlawfirm.com/document-requirements-imta/) and temporary stay permit, [KITAS](https://emerhub.com/indonesia/kitas-working-permit-indonesia/).
